Assignment #1: Anagram Checker
Background: Anagram Checker is a program that takes two words and determines if an anagram can be made from it. If so, the program will return true, otherwise false.

Part 1: Building the base Anagram Checker
Given two valid strings, check to see if they are anagrams of each other. If it is, return True, else False. For this part, we can assume that uppercase letters are the same as if it was a lowercase character.

Examples of anagrams:

Slient and Listen
Night and Think
Example outputs:

anagram_checker("Slient", "listen") # True
anagram_checker("Slient", "Night") # False
anagram_checker("night", "Thing") # True
# This is a function, which we will learn more about next week. For testing purposes, we will write our code in the function
def anagram_checker(word_a, word_b):
  # Your code here


  def anagram_checker(word_a, word_b):


        letters_a = sorted({letter.lower() for letter in word_a})
        letters_b = sorted({letter.lower() for letter in word_b})
        return letters_a == letters_b


# Run your code to check using the words below:
anagram_checker("Slient", "listen")
anagram_checker("Slient", "Night")
anagram_checker("night", "Thing")
Part 2: Expanding the functionality of the Anagram Checker
Using your existing and functional anagram checker, let's add a boolean option called is_case_sensitive, which will return True or False based on if the two compared words are anagrams and if we are checking for case sensitivity.

def anagram_checker(word_a, word_b, is_case_sensitive):
  # Modify your existing code here


def anagram_checker(word_a, word_b, is_case_sensitive):

    if is_case_sensitive == True:
        letters_a = sorted({letter for letter in word_a})
        letters_b = sorted({letter for letter in word_b})
        return letters_a == letters_b
    else:
        letters_a = sorted({letter.lower() for letter in word_a})
        letters_b = sorted({letter.lower() for letter in word_b})
        return letters_a == letters_b


# Run your code to check using the words below:
anagram_checker("Slient", "listen", False) # True
anagram_checker("Slient", "Listen", True) # False
Criteria	Pass	Fail
Code Execution	All code cells execute without errors.	Any code cell produces an error upon execution..
